            I'm Harmanpreet Singh, hailing from Jalandhar, Punjab, India. I am a
            web developer and trader.
            <br></br>I embarked on this wild trading journey with one simple
            goal: making those sweet, sweet money! So, I decided to start with a
            demo account because who wants to lose money, right?
            <br></br>I distinctly remember my first trade not going as planned,
            and that was a bit discouraging. But instead of giving up, I
            persisted and continued taking more trades.
            <br></br>I soon realized that successful trading involved more than
            just luck. I had to invest time in learning. So, I enrolled in
            courses, read books, and focused on studying the market rather than
            relying solely on indicators.
            <br></br>
            Despite my efforts, I was still facing losses more often than I'd
            like. Then, I stumbled upon 'Trading Zone' by Mark Douglas. The more
            I read it, the more I grasped that trading is primarily a mental
            game. It's not just about indicators or skill; it's about having the
            right mentality.
            <br></br>
            So, I did a 180 with my trading mindset and started watching the
            market. Instead of chasing every shiny object out there, I focused
            on my trusty companions, USDCAD and GBPJPY.
            <br></br>
            Now, after a year on this trading journey, I'm here to share what
            I've learned. Let's embark on this journey with a touch of
            seriousness and a lot of trading insights! ðŸš€ðŸ’¸
